1. Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
>> I started with just the P controller, as described by Sebastin in the lecture. 
   With the P controller, the car was oscillating on the track and crashing after
   a few seconds, before reaching the bridge. Then I introduced the D controller to 
   reduce the oscillations, but it was still crashing. After this the I component 
   was introduced and the car went further ahead. But the motion was not very smooth.

2. Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
>> I started with initial controller gain values close to what had been taught in the lesson.
   With this the car was able to complete the lap in the track. I decided to use the
   twiddle algorithm to fine tune the gain values. I have implemented the algorithm taught
   in the class. This algorithm runs once in 1000 steps and tries to minimize the cte.
   After introducing the twiddle algorithm, I am able to see that the car drives very smoothly.

Note: As can be observed in the demo video, during the initial steps the car oscillates
      a lot, but after the twiddle algorithm kicks in, the car stabilizes in it's path.
      After few iterations of the twiddle, the car runs smoothly.
