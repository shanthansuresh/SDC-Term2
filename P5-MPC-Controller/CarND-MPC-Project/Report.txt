This file describes the details of the MPC project.

[1] Compilation

[1.1]Your code should compile.
>> The code compiles successfully with cmake and make.

[2] Implementation

[2.1] The Model
>> We use the kinematic vehicle model with the following:
   -- state variables [x, y, psi, v],
      where
        x: x position of the car,
        y: y position of the car,
        psi: orientaion angle of the vehicle in the map cordinates,
        v: velocity of the car.
   
   -- actuator [delta, a],
      where
        delta: steering angle
        a: throttle (positive for acceleration, negative for brake)
 
   -- error [cte, epsi],
      whete
        cte: cross track error, difference between predicted position and desired reference position,
        epsi: orientation error.

   -- Cost function was based on the following components with weighing factors:
        cross track error (weight = 1)
        orientation error (weight = 1)
        velocity error (weight = 1)
        steering value (weight = 1) 
        throttle value (weight = 1)
        Steering change rate (weight = 2000)
        Throttle change rate (weight = 1)         
      We tried with several other combinations of the weights but the change in effect was negligible.
      Also, by boosting up the steering change rate we make sure that the drive is as smooth as possible.
      This point was discussed in the lesson.
       
   -- Update equations are based on discussions in the lesson.

[2.2] Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)
>> We choose N=25 and dt=0.05. This combination seemed to work best for us.
   We also tried with N=10 and dt=0.05, but with this combination we observe that
   the car steers out of the road.
   When we tried with N=10 and dt=0.01, the car seemed to go in right track but at
   a reduced speed of 32mph.
   With the combination of N=25 and dt=0.03, the car was oscillating too much in the track.
   The conclusion is that suitable combination of N, dt and weights for the cost function enable us
   to make the controller as smooth as possible.

[2.3]Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
>> As the lap in the test track is almost stright we choose a first order polynomial and fit the waypoints
   to a first order polynomial. 
   We also perform a transformation of the waypoints and vehicle from map cordinates to the vehicle cordinates.
   This transformation is reverse of what has been done for particle filter. The main reason for performing this
   transformation is the convenience in terms of fitting the polynomial, calculating the cte, visualization.
   Please refer to lines 131-156 in main.cpp for the equations.

[2.4] Model Predictive Control with Latency
>> We use the kinematic vehicle model to predict the vehicle state in the future. In order to accomodate
   for latency, we calculate the vehicle state for the future time which is "latency" seconds ahead of the
   current time. We feed this as the current state to the state solver. In this way we capture the latency
   involved between issuing the actuator command and the command being executed. 
   Please refer to lines 104-129 in main.cpp for the equations.
